### Goal
The goal of this project was to implement the model from the paper titled "Automatic Brain Tumor Segmentation using Cascaded Anisotropic Convolutional Neural Networks." The authors of this paper implemented a model for the international BRaTs brain tumor segmentation competition that won 2nd place.

The authors provide code for their implementation in TensorFlow version 1; however, I decided to re-implement my own version of this using TensorFlow 2.2. I believe there is added benefit in this implementation, as it uses the more current version of TensorFlow and greatly simplifies some of the original code (which was very difficult to read, especially the data pre-processing steps).

The model is fully implemented and runs. At first, I ran into hardware limitation issues with trying the original (19, 144, 144) image patch size that the authors use, so I resolved this by pre-processing the images to crop an ROI around the brain region and greatly reduce the size of the input images. This allowed me to successfully reduce the size of the input patches to (19, 98, 98). A batch size of 4 was as high as I could go given by GPU hardware limits and the heaviness of the model itself, but it seemed to cause no detriment (authors used a batch size of 5). Yet another aspect that may improve learning would be a `weight_map` that functions as a mask around the brain region such that the loss is only considered inside of the brain region (and not in the surrounding background).
